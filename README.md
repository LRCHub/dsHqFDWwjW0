```lrc
[00:09.28] The sky's a different kind of blue
[00:16.03] Wanted it to be you
[00:20.27] Some things just aren't meant to be
[00:23.85] It's easy to say, I still can't see
[00:41.35] 
[00:28.69] You with anybody else
[00:33.02] There's no amount of wealth
[00:38.06] That could ease this poor goodbye
[00:41.87] Soften the fall, from your sky
[00:56.87] 
[00:53.35] It's so typical of me
[01:01.46] And I'm sure that you'd agree
[01:09.31] That I can be a little much
[01:13.47] I overthink, I scared you off
[01:17.63] My spiral begins, right on cue
[01:25.40] I wonder if I'll ever find
[01:29.17] Someone new
[01:34.67] 
[01:37.55] I have to get off Instagram
[01:43.32] I keep on going back
[01:48.00] Looking at our memories
[01:51.65] I know that you will soon delete
[02:07.65] 
[01:56.21] We turn to strangers in a day
[02:01.57] Now you walk away
[02:06.31] Every time I catch your eye
[02:09.96] When did you become so shy?
[02:23.46] 
[02:21.58] It's so typical of me
[02:29.29] I'm sure that you'd agree
[02:37.48] That I can be a little much
[02:41.41] I overthink, I scared you off
[02:45.63] My spiral begins, right on cue
[02:53.41] This time, I swear I won't find
[02:59.21] Someone new
[03:04.58] Someone new
