I'll find someone new
Hey
I'll find someone new

You never really loved me
It's too late to disagree
There's so much more to life out there
Then you've ever given me

I don't wanna hear excuses
Don't pretend you don't know why
Everything we had is over now
And it's time to say goodbye

Each night I was alone with you
I could see myself with someone new
Each night I was alone with you
I imagined what it would be like with someone new

'Cause you never trusted me
You never wanted me
You never cared for me
But I don't mind
I've got my dignity
I'm not his property
I've got the strength to leave it all behind

I'll find someone new
I'll find someone new

Now you beg me for forgiveness
How the tables have been turned
But I'm not the girl I was back then
My lessons have been learned

You don't care about my feelings
There is nothing left to say
Everything we had is over now
And it's time to walk away

Each night I was alone with you
I could see myself with someone new
Each night I was alone with you
I imagined what it would be like with someone new

'Cause you never trusted me
You never wanted me
You never cared for me
But I don't mind
I've got my dignity
I'm not his property
I've got the strength to leave it all behind

You never trusted me
You never wanted me
You never cared for me
But I don't mind
I've got my dignity
I'm not his property
I've got the strength to leave it all behind

Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
