The sky's
a different kind of blue
Wanted it to be you
Some things just
aren't meant to be
It's easy to say,
I still can't see
You with anybody else
There's no amount of wealth
That could ease
this poor goodbye
Soften the fall, from your sky
It's so typical of me
And I'm sure that
you'd agree, oh
That I can be a little much
I overthink, I scared you off
My spiral begins, right on cue
I wonder if I'll ever
find someone new
I have to get off Instagram
I keep on going back
Looking at our memories
I know that
you will soon delete
We turn to strangers in a day
Now you walk away
Every time I catch your eye
When did you become so shy?
It's so typical of me
I'm sure that you'd agree, oh
That I can be a little much
I overthink, I scared you off
My spiral begins, right on cue
This time I swear
I won't find someone new
Someone new
